Dear HENNGE Recruitment Team,

When I first learned about HENNGE's mission of "Liberation of Technology," it immediately resonated with something I've been doing throughout my university years. As Vice President of our robotics club, I spent countless hours making complex robotics and IoT systems accessible to fellow students who were intimidated by the hardware-software integration challenges. Watching someone's face light up when they finally got their first autonomous robot working reminded me why I fell in love with technology in the first place - it's not just about building cool things, it's about making those cool things accessible to everyone.

Your Full Stack Software Engineering Internship represents exactly the kind of environment where I can grow while contributing meaningfully. What draws me to HENNGE isn't just the impressive tech stack of Python, Go, and TypeScript that aligns perfectly with my experience, but the way you've built a culture around curiosity and continuous learning. The fact that your CEO is also your CTO tells me this is a place where technical excellence isn't just valued - it's lived at every level. Having founded my own VR startup and led a 10-person team, I understand the unique energy that comes from working in tight-knit, autonomous teams where everyone has a voice in shaping the product's future.

My decision to pursue opportunities in Japan isn't casual - I've been studying Japanese for over a year and recently achieved N5 certification because I believe the best way to contribute to a culture is to understand it deeply. Japan's approach to craftsmanship and continuous improvement, combined with HENNGE's international perspective, creates an environment I find genuinely compelling. Through my experience building everything from neural networks to finance management platforms, I've learned that the most innovative solutions often come from bringing together different perspectives and approaches.

What excites me most about this internship is the opportunity to work on real-world problems that matter. My background spans from integrating robotics sensors with web dashboards at SS Innovations to building AI-powered research platforms, but what ties it all together is a love for solving complex problems through clean, scalable code. The 7,000+ person tech community I've built on social media started because I wanted to share what I was learning - whether it was implementing transformers from scratch or optimizing ML pipelines with MLOps tools. That same drive to learn, build, and share is what I'd bring to HENNGE's team.

I'm ready to dive into the full-stack training, contribute to your DevOps practices, and tackle whatever special assignment comes my way. More than that, I'm ready to be part of a team that's genuinely changing how people interact with technology, making it more secure and accessible for everyone.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and enthusiasm can contribute to HENNGE's continued success.

Best regards,
Mayank Pratap Singh
